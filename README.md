This project is designed to build a number plate recognition system using computer vision, Open CV and optical character recognition (OCR). The objective is to accurately detect and extract the textual content of a vehicle's number plate from an image. Such systems have wide applications in areas like traffic enforcement, automated toll booths, parking management systems, and border control.
